Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851).
I have created this as a part of quizzes/tasks.

It covers the following lessons:

1. Create basic app with List View
2. Connect to Cloud
3. Fragments and Background thread
4. Create Activities and navigate with Intents
5. Activity Lifecycle and Data
6. JUnit TestCases
7. Content Providers
8. Hooking Content Providers with Loaders
9. Rich and Responsive Layout
10. Service and notifications

To run it succesfully, we need to add an api key from https://openweathermap.org/ into the build.grade
